# Roadmap

## Scope source

README paragraph 1 is authoritative: aggregate repeated work into a regular, if large, function covering
many situations and edge cases; once built and verified, that function is deterministic. M2-M4 reconcile
the project to it. Paragraph 1 states the goal, so alignment work moves the system toward it and never
narrows the paragraph to fit the code.

Measured gaps driving the arc:

- `that function` has no referent. Verification is per artifact - own fixtures plus 4 negative probes
  (`system.py` `_run_verification`). No aggregate identity, coverage measure, cross-entry check, or export.
  An artifact is one input-output pair (`artifacts.py` `build_exact_lookup`). -> M2.
- `if large` is operationally blocked. `verify <artifact_id>` and `promote <artifact_id> --scope-hash`
  are per entry (`cli.py`), so N situations cost N human-typed hashes. -> M2.
- Post-promotion determinism is revocable: revocation, ambiguity, integrity failure, suspension, or a new
  operation revision move a resolved input to fallback. A sealed ledger-free bundle makes the paragraph's
  determinism claim literally true. -> M2.
- Coverage of many situations is produced outside the boundary. Cement supplies the middle lookup; the
  input projection and output interpretation are unverified caller code
  (`examples/hospital_ocr/pipeline.py` `layout_signature`, `apply_plan`), and M1 review found three real
  defects in that projection which no Cement gate reaches. -> M4.
- Beyond the paragraph: bundled LLM-invocation runtime (`source.py`, `_command_supervisor.py`,
  `example_adapter.py`, `docs/adapter-protocol.md`), inline-proxy machinery (leases, request-ID
  idempotency, `in_progress`/`retry_failed`/`fallback_failed`/`reconciliation_required`), and the
  `authority(partition, actor, action, subject)` callback in a system the README calls not an ACL system.
  -> M3 trims all three.

## Milestone ledger

- M1 - Hospital OCR-to-JSON example - REVIEWED (`9e50bed..6f4f260`). Ships `examples/hospital_ocr/`
  (7-document corpus over 3 layouts, `pipeline.py`, `plan_adapter.py`, `run_demo.py`, walkthrough README)
  plus `tests/test_hospital_ocr_example.py`. Teaching claim: one durable pipeline replaces per-run bespoke
  LLM extraction, because each layout's plan is proposed once, supervised, then promoted. Review fixed
  three `layout_signature` canonicalization defects and bound the adapter's reference plans to locator
  compatibility. Gauges: implementing teammates 27-33%, MAIN 76-96%. Detail: `.agent/archive/m1.md`.

- M2 - Function as object - REVIEWED (`71c5eab..83198e1`; review read `6f4f260..e5ff481`). Makes the
  aggregate deterministic function a first-class, verifiable, exportable artifact, so paragraph 1's
  `regular, if large, function` and `once built and verified, that function is deterministic` become
  checkable properties instead of per-entry claims. Trust boundary stays exact-lookup: a function is a set
  of exact entries, never a wider predicate. Shipped across 16 units (u1..u5b, all DONE): the
  `cement-function-v2` document, hash and pure evaluator; set-level `verify_function` checks P1-P6;
  pre-promotion `entry_seal` identity plus batch draft verification; persisted `function_receipts` +
  `function_memberships` at `SCHEMA_VERSION` 2 with one-hash set promotion; receipt discovery and
  historical reconstruction; `function_report` over a frozen build anchor and an operation-now anchor; the
  eight-leaf `function` CLI group (`show`, `receipts`, `verify-drafts`, `verify`, `inspect`, `promote`,
  `export`, `eval`) on one `_Outcome` seam with exit 6 as the negative-verdict class; the hospital example
  resolving a layout offline from an exported bundle; and a docs claim pass over `README.md` plus
  `docs/`. Suite 81 -> 548. Gauges: `main=` 62-100%, teammate `impl=`/`mate=` 44-92%. Detail - per-unit
  records, design forks, review findings, known limits: `.agent/archive/m2.md`.

- M3 - Trim to paragraph scope - IN-PROGRESS (plan `bbac234..`). Removes behavior outside `turns
  repeatedly supervised LLM answers into narrowly scoped deterministic behavior`. Owner-approved seeds:
  (a) `CandidateSource` protocol stays in core while `CommandCandidateSource`, the subreaper/process-group
  supervisor, `example_adapter.py`, and `docs/adapter-protocol.md` relocate to an optional example
  surface; (b) the `authority()` callback goes, keeping reviewer and actor recording, which supervision
  genuinely requires; (c) the request lifecycle (leases, request-ID idempotency, `in_progress`,
  `retry_failed`, `fallback_failed`, `reconciliation_required`) is replaced by an explicit proposal
  submission plus a pure read-only `resolve`, leaving request lifecycle to the caller. Schema bumps once
  to 3; no migration path pre-1.0.

  Track order = (b) -> (c) -> (a): (b) is schema-neutral and independently landable, and landing it first
  stops (c) from building an authority gate on the new submission API only to delete it; (a) waits
  because its retained protocol names `CandidateRequest.request_id`, which (c) deletes, and because
  moving it earlier leaves the core CLI unable to turn a miss into a proposal.

  Correction to this roadmap's own prior wording: M2 did NOT reshape the dispatch path. All ten
  dispatch-path functions and the `requests` table are byte-identical across `3b7769b`, `6f4f260`,
  `71c5eab`, `83198e1` and HEAD (`handle` `cd60036faf5c`/12,867 B; `requests` `97190cf406eaa75e`/2,265 B).
  The scheduling conclusion survives for a different reason: M2 supplies the resolver target
  (`FunctionMatch`/`evaluate`) and adds request-bound report consumers that (c) must rewrite.

  Schema cuts ONCE, at M3.6b. M3.3-M3.6a keep `SCHEMA_VERSION` 2 and use private fresh request rows as
  internal storage plumbing that no public API exposes. The rejected expand-migrate-contract split
  (v3 compatibility columns, then v4 deletion) earns its second bump only where deployed operators cross
  it; under this milestone's own fail-closed no-migration contract nobody does, so it would uniquely pay
  two disposable transient test families plus two mid-milestone rewrites for zero operator value.

  Units - 13, 1 DONE + 12 OPEN, executing as 7 waves. `depends` shows the DAG; same-wave units name the same
  predecessor. Tier default `kernel`; `oracle` is kept only where an independent implementation can
  actually diverge, so deletion, forwarding and byte-preserving relocation carry none.

  - M3.1 DONE tier=kernel tags=- depends=none - deleted the `authority()` callback and its scaffolds.
    `main=` 92% 220K/240K, `mate=` 54% 129K/240K. Contract + attack record:
    `.agent/decisions/m3u1-contract.md`. Shipped: `AuthorityCheck`, the `System.__init__` `authority`
    keyword, `self._authority`, `_authorize` and all 11 call sites gone; both double-plan
    authorization-window scaffolds collapsed to ONE locked plan; the empty-union gate and every
    actor/reviewer capture, validation, persistence and event survive; `store.py` byte-identical to
    `3a53389` at `SCHEMA_VERSION` 2. Suite 548 -> 548 (11 authorization-only tests deleted, 21 rewritten,
    11 added as `tests/test_authority_removal.py`).

    CALIBRATION RESULT, binding on M3.2a..M3.9b. One single-author kernel unit consumed 92% of MAIN.
    Cost split, measured: ~25K wave-1 surface reading (the 61 KB track map alone), ~40K implementation,
    ~35K a single unplanned context dump, the rest coordination and closure. So a unit of this shape
    fits one window with NO margin, and M3.1 was the SMALLEST unit in the milestone. Every later unit
    must therefore either shrink below M3.1's static source span or split before it opens; M3.5b, M3.6a,
    M3.6b, M3.7 and M3.9a all exceed it as written and need a pre-open split. Two mechanics earned their
    cost and should repeat: scripted, count-asserted, idempotent test surgery instead of per-test hand
    edits, and a pre-implementation contract attack that ran concurrently with implementation.
    ORACLE SURCHARGE, SETTLED. M3.1 carried `tags=-`, so its 92% bought NO `orc`, NO `diff` and no
    divergence rulings, and the split list above ranks static source span alone -- which is why it flags
    five `-`/`prod` units and not one of the four `oracle` units (M3.2a, M3.2b, M3.3, M3.4), each of
    which pays a battery the calibration never measured. Pricing route 1 (measure against M2's oracle
    units) is UNAVAILABLE: project history holds ZERO `orc` and ZERO `diff` dispatches across 269
    `.scratch/agents/` artifacts, and M2's single oracle mention is a rejection
    (`.agent/archive/m2.md:454` - a forwarding leaf's reference implementation is the same forwarding
    code). Archaeology over non-oracle analogs would manufacture a forecast and carry it across a
    document boundary as a measurement, a defect this project has already paid for. RULING: M3.2a is the
    ORACLE-CALIBRATION unit, run under route 2's protective split - wave 1 plus acceptance contract
    first, MAIN gauge read at contract close, implementation opening only if projected cost fits the
    one-window aim, else the contract becomes the next session's entry state. Record M3.2a's
    `orc`/`diff` MAIN cost separately from its base at close; that measurement, never an estimate, sizes
    M3.2b, M3.3 and M3.4. Tags stay as reviewed - seven campaigns were already cut to three and
    justified per unit (`.agent/decisions/m3-plan-review.md` L86-88), so cost was the only open question.
  - M3.2a OPEN tier=kernel tags=oracle depends=none - Store-owned enforced-read capability: existing-only
    `file:` URI with `mode=ro`, `PRAGMA query_only`, write-denying authorizer, one rolled-back
    transaction. Oracle-calibration unit per the ruling above. Measured static span = 46 production
    lines, both methods in `store.py`: `_connect` L488-511 and `transaction` L550-571. Blast radius =
    32 `.transaction(` call sites in `system.py` (57 `write=True` / 90 other, repo-wide), 113 in
    `test_system.py`. Base span sits far under M3.1's, which is what leaves room for the battery.
  - M3.2b tier=kernel tags=oracle depends=M3.2a - one-snapshot P1-P6 verification plus `evaluate` behind
    a pure `resolve`; failed verification, verified miss and verified hit stay distinct; publish durable
    1/1,000/50,000 measurements.
  - M3.3 tier=kernel tags=oracle depends=M3.1 - request-free direct and source-backed submission over
    unchanged schema v2. Also owns `src/cement_runtime/errors.py`: `CandidateSourceError` stays public,
    its supervised-fallback docstring is rewritten, and both it and an arbitrary `Exception` normalize to
    exact public text with no durable row or event, so a broken source leaks nothing. Runs parallel with
    M3.2b.
  - M3.4 tier=kernel tags=oracle depends=M3.3 - freeze request-free proposal/read/review/report/event
    public seams behind one internal binding adapter, schema still v2.
  - M3.5a tier=kernel tags=- depends=M3.2b,M3.4 - add `resolve` and `proposal submit` CLI channels with
    exact exit and payload contracts. The submission channel shape is an open fork - one spike compares an
    aggregate JSON envelope against direct flags, stdin and file, including framing bound and exact error
    behavior - because the maps select explicit submission without measuring any channel.
  - M3.5b tier=kernel tags=- depends=M3.5a - remove `handle`/`request`/source grammar, imports, fixtures,
    help and operator prose.
  - M3.6a tier=kernel tags=- depends=M3.5b - delete public lifecycle methods, leases, result models and
    exports; retain only the private v2 binding plumbing.
  - M3.6b tier=kernel tags=prod depends=M3.6a - the sole schema cut v2->v3: direct proposal columns,
    adapter swap, `requests` plus index deletion, refusal fixtures, package 0.2.0.
  - M3.7 tier=kernel tags=prod depends=M3.3,M3.5b - relocate the command runtime to an optional example
    surface with byte equality, archive membership and blocked reverse imports. Owns its destination paths
    explicitly (implementation, sibling supervisor, stub, README), rules whether the source-only example
    may depend on private JSON helpers, states that `py.typed` covers core only, and mocks the
    direct-process-only platform branch, which ships untested today. `uv build` measured: the wheel
    carries zero `examples/` and zero `tests/` members, so no `pyproject.toml` change is required. Runs
    alongside M3.6.
  - M3.8 tier=data tags=prod depends=M3.6b - regenerate the hospital demo and its pinned transcript
    through an idempotent updater. May run alongside M3.7.
  - M3.9a tier=docs tags=- depends=M3.6b,M3.7,M3.8 - rewrite the 145-row claim ledger, every core,
    example and optional-runner doc, plus the release and recovery record.
  - M3.9b tier=docs tags=- depends=M3.9a - independent final claim, command, help, archive, link and
    register replay; a code defect reopens the owning kernel unit.

  Acceptance is per-unit and quantified in `.agent/decisions/m3-plan-review.md` L5; a green suite plus a
  prose assertion is NEVER closure for a removal, because deleting a behavior together with its pin keeps
  the gate green. Every unit's battery must fail when one obligation remains undone or one preserved
  invariant disappears, and must rerun from that unit's committed checkpoint.

  SIZING CAVEAT - M3 opens with NO validated one-window estimator. Every M2 gauge was recorded under split
  authorship, MAIN paying coordination while a teammate paid implementation; MAIN now pays both from one
  window, so no M2 half predicts an M3 unit. M3.1 is therefore the calibration unit: record its actual
  `main=` at close and resize every later unit against that measurement before opening it. Undershooting
  is cheap here because the three surface maps carry 740 resolving `file:line` anchors, which replaces
  whole-file rereads with targeted reads and makes fine cuts cheaper than the giant-file heuristic
  assumes. A pre-open size trigger must be a STATIC source-span budget; a trigger that needs the
  completed diff (byte equality, post-factoring line counts) is unmeasurable before the unit opens.

  Evidence, all tracked and re-runnable: `.agent/decisions/m3-map-a-llm-runtime.md` (229 anchors),
  `m3-map-b-authority.md` (212), `m3-map-c-lifecycle.md` (299), `m3-research.md` (Q1-Q4, executed probes),
  `m3-plan-draft.md`, `m3-plan-review.md` (54 findings, 8 lenses). Structural validator =
  `uv run python .agent/decisions/m3-report-validate.py <report.md>`; all six pass.

- M4 - Projection inside the boundary - UNPLANNED. Brings the step that actually produces coverage of many
  situations under supervision and verification: a projection artifact kind mapping raw input to canonical
  key, replayed against every confirmed raw input plus boundary probes, with counterexample gates and
  fail-closed behavior on unrecognized input. Open design question for planning: how a projection is
  verified without a domain oracle. Deferred entries `Typed schemas + verifier plugin ABI` and
  `Broader finite decision tables / constrained expression IR` seed this milestone. Output interpretation
  (`apply_plan`-class execution) inside the boundary is a separate later decision.

## Core (completed)

- Supervised fallback, evidence ledger, compiler recurrence/stability gates, verification/promotion,
  runtime safeguards, and CLI/API/docs/tests/package verification.

## Deferred - contract/deployment expansion

Scope expansion, i.e. future-milestone material that planning promotes into units. Off-spine defects and
deferred perfection on shipped surfaces live in `.agent/polish.md` instead.

- Typed schemas + verifier plugin ABI (M4 seed).
- Broader finite decision tables / constrained expression IR (M4 seed).
- Authenticated reviewer identities, encryption, retention, remote registry/signatures.
- Shadow sampling + production drift telemetry.
- TypedDict projections + dynamic inspection records.
- Owner-selected license + absolute repository/documentation URLs before public publication.
